# Static Site Generator v1.0
**Python project that converts a full markdown file into HTML code and serves it locally via HTTP as a static website. Utilizes Object Oriented Programming, Unit Tests, and recursion.**

Running `python3 ./main.sh` from the root directory will translate `index.md` into HTML code, write it to index.html file, copy all files from `static` folder to `public` folder, and serve the finished product via HTTP on `http://localhost:8888/`

Run `./test.sh` from the root directory to run all tests.
